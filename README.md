# Wales-coop targeted engagement tool

## Problem

It is important for Wales Co-op to maintain its relationship with SMEs and its repuation as being the go-to place for advice. This is important for driving small businesses towards SBW when they are looking for advice and also for Wales Co-op as they position themselves for a future where they will have to charge for advisory services. At the moment, there is a lot of already written content that if delivered in a timely fashion, SMEs might be able to get a lot of value from. However, this content is currently sequestered on the SBW or Wales Co-op websites and the number of SMEs accessing it is low.

## Solution

The targeted engagement tool takes existing resouces containing business advice and presents them to SMEs in an appealing and accessible way. The tool combines this with information specific to the business to tailor this experience. The agreed overarching user story from the hackday was 'I can virtually access specific business advice from the tech I use daily.'
